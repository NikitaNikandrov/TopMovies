# TopMovies

TopMovies was the test application for interview.
It used TMDb API to get some data of top movies 2019.
It can send you reminder notifications to see the movie at date you had shoosen.

Now a have added capability of searching by year, sorting movies and adding to favourits. Also I made some design update.
